How do you take your coffee? Well, in this data analysis, we went through the processes of scrubbing the data clean, then producing visualisations in Microsoft Excel to show the relationship between different types of data, to show you how others might, regarding their favourite cafes. The dataset used in this task is attached, and the completed data set and three visualisations.

 
****Scrubbing the Data** - 
**Data Cleaning**
The first step to this process was scrubbing the data on Microsoft Excel. The data that was present had missing values and it was important that all the columns adhered to the right data type. The scenario for this task was that a company called Caffiene Form was company that sells cups to coffee shops thorugh their website and they were tracking their stores through reviews to help market their product better. The columsn consisted of Region, Place Name, Place Type, Rating, Review, Price, Delivery Option, Dinne in Option and Take Out Option. Each column needed to be checked for the right data type and the missing values replaced with "Unknown", or "$" equating ot the number of prices, as well as the negatives replaced by Falses. Thus after a bit  of cleaning using the find and replae method within Excel, we turned this data set:

**Figure 1:** There were characters in the names of the coffee shops that would not be understood in the data , so after a bit of manual cleaning we manage to clear the coffee shop names, as they were not legible in the English language

****Into this dataset:**

I then performed a bit of data analysis in regard to the clients questions, producing some visualisations.

This visualisation shows that the coffee shops is the most generalised shop out there and the choice favourite of cafes, reaching the highest number of counts, followed shortly by 58 visits to a cafe. From this deduction we can therefore say that due to the wider range of products the place has a higher number of visits. The ones that are niche seem to have less reviews because they only sell a specific product type, so as a result might have less of a visitor count. Simple data can reveal so much information about the way a company can then market its product along the places there, from the small insights here, more questions can be asked and in turn more visualisations produced.

Another visualisation was created to show the reviews number by the number of coffee shops, according to the data there the highest of reviews was 71077 so it can be relatively safe to say that there is a correlation between the most common coffee store adn the number of reviews, as the place was visited more, it doesn't neccesarily equate to it being the most successful store but it seems to have the highest market, thus our coffee cup producers would be making recycable cups and marketing them starting with prioritising the cofee shops, this insight would then be in a real scenario traded to the marketing team, data can be used to make decisions.
